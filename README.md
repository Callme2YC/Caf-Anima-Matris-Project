# Cafe-Anima-Matris-Project

## Overview
This project aims to enhance the Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) score of coffee by optimizing the fermentation and drying processes through data analytics. Using machine learning techniques, we developed predictive models to forecast optimal conditions for these processes, providing actionable insights for consistently producing high-quality coffee beans.

## Web Page

We have developed a comprehensive web page using Notion to provide an in-depth overview of the project. This page includes all resources, user guides, and demonstration videos to facilitate understanding and usage.

## Introduction
The primary objective of this project is to optimize the coffee fermentation and drying processes using data analytics to improve the SCA score. This includes designing data collection protocols, developing machine learning models, and creating user-friendly interfaces for stakeholders.

## Project Impact and Solutions

### Addressing Pain Points from the SoW

1. **Data Collection and Management:**
   - **Solution:** Designed an Airtable-based database with data collection templates, forms, and dashboards to streamline data entry and management.
   - **Notes:** provided login credentials and links to access Airtable and Notion.
   - **Impact:** Simplifies data collection for coffee farmers and administrators, ensuring accuracy and consistency in recorded data.

2. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - **Solution:** Developed predictive models for both washed and honey fermentation methods, using synthetic data generated from real-world conditions.
   - **Impact:** Provides actionable insights to optimize fermentation and drying processes, directly contributing to improved SCA scores.

3. **User-Friendly Interfaces:**
   - **Solution:** Created chatbots based on the predictive models to help non-technical users easily interact with the data and receive predictions.
   - **Impact:** Ensures that the clients can make data-driven decisions without needing extensive technical knowledge.

4. **Automation and Efficiency:**
   - **Solution:** Implemented automated data collection processes and tools to reduce manual effort and minimize errors.
